## 📦 Dataset

This project uses the **London Bike Sharing** dataset obtained from Kaggle:  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset

The dataset contains hourly bike rental records in London from 2015 to 2017 (approximately 17,414 rows).  
The main features include:

- **timestamp**: date and time of observation  
- **cnt**: total number of bike rentals  
- **t1, t2**: actual temperature and “feels-like” temperature (°C)  
- **hum**: humidity (%)  
- **wind_speed**: wind speed (km/h)  
- **weather_code**: weather condition category code  
- **is_holiday**: holiday indicator (1 = holiday, 0 = non-holiday)  
- **is_weekend**: weekend indicator (1 = weekend, 0 = weekday)  
- **season**: season category (0–3)  

This dataset is used to build a **regression model** to predict **bike rental demand** based on environmental and temporal conditions.

# MSIB London Bike Demand Prediction

This project is part of the **MSIB (Merdeka Belajar Kampus Merdeka)** program and focuses on analyzing the **London Bike Sharing Dataset** to predict bike rental demand using **regression methods**.

## 📌 Project Background
The increasing use of sustainable transportation plays an important role in reducing **air pollution** and traffic congestion in urban areas. Bike-sharing systems are one of the eco-friendly solutions that support this goal. Therefore, accurate demand prediction is needed to improve bike availability and operational efficiency.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze patterns and factors affecting bike rental demand
- Build a **regression-based prediction model** for bike-sharing demand
- Support decision-making for sustainable transportation planning to help reduce air pollution

## 🧠 Methodology
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection
- Regression modeling (e.g., Linear Regression / Multiple Regression)
- Model evaluation using performance metrics

## 📊 Dataset
- **London Bike Sharing Dataset**
- Features include weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and time-related variables

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## 📈 Expected Outcome
A regression model capable of predicting bike rental demand, which can be used as a reference to encourage bike usage as an alternative transportation mode to help reduce **air pollution**.
